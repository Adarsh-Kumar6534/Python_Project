# 🕵️ Crime Data Analysis

## 🎯 Overview

This project analyzes crime data to uncover patterns and trends across various dimensions such as time, location, offense types, and weapon usage. The objective is to provide actionable insights for law enforcement and policymakers.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes information on crime incidents with the following fields:

- **OFFENSE**: Type of crime committed.
- **SHIFT**: Time shift during which the crime occurred (e.g., MIDNIGHT, DAY, EVENING).
- **METHOD**: Method or weapon used in the crime.
- **BLOCK**: Block address where the crime occurred.
- **WARD**: Ward number where the crime occurred.
- **NEIGHBORHOOD_CLUSTER**: Neighborhood cluster of the crime location.
- **LATITUDE** and **LONGITUDE**: Geographical coordinates of the crime.
- **START_DATE** and **END_DATE**: Start and end dates of the crime incident.
- **REPORT_DAT**: Date when the crime was reported.

## 🗒️ Objectives for the Analysis

1. ✅ Analyze crime incidents over different time periods (monthly, weekly, hourly).
2. ✅ Examine the distribution of crime types and identify the most frequent offenses.
3. ✅ Investigate crime counts by neighborhood clusters to identify high-crime areas.
4. ✅ Explore the geographical distribution of crimes using latitude and longitude data.
5. ✅ Analyze weapon usage in violent crimes and their distribution across offense types.
6. ✅ Visualize crime types by ward using heatmaps for spatial analysis.

## 📊 Data Visualizations

The analysis includes the following visualizations:

- **Line Plot**: Crime incidents by month.
- **Bar Chart**: Crime incidents by day of the week.
- **Horizontal Bar Chart**: Crime incidents by shift.
- **Bar Chart**: Distribution of all crime types.
- **Count Plot**: Top 5 crime types by shift.
- **Pie Chart**: Top 10 neighborhoods by crime count.
- **Box Plots**: Latitude and longitude distribution by crime type.
- **Donut Chart**: Weapons used in violent crimes.
- **Grouped Bar Plot**: Weapon usage by crime type.
- **Heatmap**: Crime types by ward.

## 🚀 Key Insights and Findings

1. ✅ **Temporal Patterns**: Crime incidents vary across different months, days, and hours, indicating temporal trends in criminal activities.
2. ✅ **Crime Types**: Certain offenses occur more frequently, with the top 5 crime types accounting for a significant portion of all incidents.
3. ✅ **Neighborhood Analysis**: Specific neighborhood clusters exhibit higher crime rates, highlighting areas that may require targeted interventions.
4. ✅ **Geographical Distribution**: The spatial analysis reveals clusters of crimes in particular wards, assisting in resource allocation for law enforcement.
5. ✅ **Weapon Usage**: Analysis of violent crimes shows the prevalence of certain weapons, aiding in understanding the nature of these offenses.
6. ✅ **Ward-Level Analysis**: Heatmaps of crime types by ward provide a visual  representation of crime distribution, facilitating strategic planning.
